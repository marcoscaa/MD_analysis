Run the code as
make 
./dtc.x dipole.lammpstrj index_dac

The file index_dac is a single line file containing:

natoms ndipole nframes nequil dt tcorr

natoms: total number of atoms in the lammpstrj file
ndipole: total number of dipole centers
nframes: total number of frames in the lammpstrj file
nequil: number of initial snapshots to be discarded
dt: timestep in ps (difference in time between consecutive snapshots in the lammpstrj file)
tcorr: total number of time (in dt units) to be considered in the time correlation function (2 ps should be enough)
