# Tools to analyse MD trajectories

This repo contains a series of Fortran codes I made over the years to post-process
MD trajectories. These codes are NOT user friendly, and (in most cases) not intuitive
to run. Some variables are hard-coded, and not all codes are for general use. However,
you can take the source code and modify it at will.
